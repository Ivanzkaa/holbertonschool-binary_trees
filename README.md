<h2>General</h2>

    What is a binary tree

    What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree

    What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists

    What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree

    What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree

    What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
